# TopoMapGen
A tool for generating topographic maps from terrain.party data

This is a tool that is able to generate customizable topographic maps from gradient maps provided from terrain.party. For example, you can change the number of lines that will be displayed on the map or their relative thershold (which effects the line's thickness).
